This project is an interactive Python Turtle game that tests your decision making skills through different scenarios one might face in a Computer Science course. Each choice you make affects your outcome, giving you information into how your decisions might impact your success in the course.
As you play, the program tracks your responses, and gives you your expected outcome of the course.
